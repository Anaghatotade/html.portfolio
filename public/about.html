<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Anagha, a B.Tech student pursuing Chemical Engineering at IIT Indore. My journey here has been an exciting blend of academic challenges, technical explorations, and creative pursuits. From the very beginning, I have been passionate about applying theoretical concepts to real-world problems. This curiosity led me to work on projects like optimizing milk transportation and pasteurization, where I developed energy-efficient models using Python and Jupyter. Another significant project involved aromatic hydrocarbon separation, where my team and I achieved high benzene recovery through process optimization. These experiences have shaped my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills..</p>

<p>Apart from academics, I believe in staying actively involved in my college community. I am a member of the Alumni Cell, E-Cell, and D_alphaXcrew, where I enjoy collaborating with like-minded peers. Dance is also a big part of who I am—I’ve proudly represented my institute in Inter IIT events and taken on hosting responsibilities for aquatic meets. Balancing technical projects with creative activities keeps me grounded and motivated. Looking ahead, I aim to gain practical experience through internships and research, leveraging my technical knowledge and leadership skills to make a positive impact.</p>
